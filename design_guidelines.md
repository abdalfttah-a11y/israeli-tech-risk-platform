# Design Guidelines: Intelligence Platform for IT Risk Analysis

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Taking inspiration from sophisticated intelligence and cybersecurity platforms like CrowdStrike, Palantir, and Splunk. This approach is justified by the project's need for professional credibility, data visualization complexity, and intelligence-focused functionality.

## Core Design Principles
- **Intelligence-Grade Professionalism**: Design should convey authority and sophistication
- **Dark Theme Dominance**: Professional cybersecurity aesthetic with high contrast
- **Data-First Visual Hierarchy**: Information architecture prioritizes data clarity
- **Geopolitical Sensitivity**: Respectful, analytical presentation without inflammatory visuals

- **Accent**: Outfit (headings, branding elements)

Font weights: 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semibold), 700 (bold)

## Layout System
**Tailwind Spacing Primitives**: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24
- Consistent 8-unit grid system
- Dense information layouts with breathing room
- Responsive breakpoints prioritizing desktop-first approach

## Component Library

### Core Navigation
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Collapsible with intelligence categories
- **Top Bar**: Search, notifications, user profile
- **Breadcrumbs**: Clear hierarchical navigation

### Data Displays
- **Intelligence Cards**: Company profiles with risk indicators
- **Data Tables**: Sortable, filterable with pagination
- **Risk Meters**: Visual risk assessment indicators
- **Geographic Maps**: Interactive company distribution
- **Charts**: Line, bar, and radar charts for trend analysis

### Interactive Elements
- **Smart Filters**: Multi-select with live results
- **Export Controls**: PDF, Excel, CSV options
- **Risk Toggle**: Switch between risk levels
- **Search**: Global search with suggestions

### Information Architecture
- **Dashboard Overview**: Executive summary with key metrics
- **Company Database**: Searchable directory with detailed profiles
- **Risk Analysis**: Dedicated risk assessment tools
- **Reports**: Generated intelligence reports
- **Sources**: Citation and reference management

## Visual Treatments

### Critical Design Elements
- **Risk Color Coding**: Consistent across all components
  - High Risk: Red indicators
  - Medium Risk: Amber/Orange indicators  
  - Low Risk: Green indicators
  - Unknown: Gray indicators

- **Professional Icons**: Heroicons for consistency
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js or similar for interactive graphs
- **Geographic Elements**: Interactive maps showing company locations

### Content Strategy
- **Authoritative Tone**: Professional, analytical language
- **Data-Driven**: Heavy emphasis on statistics and metrics
- **Source Attribution**: Clear citation of information sources
- **Risk-Focused**: Consistent emphasis on security implications

## Images
No large hero images. Instead, focus on:
- **Infographic Elements**: Data visualization charts and graphs
- **Company Logos**: Small, professional company identification
- **Geographic Maps**: Interactive world/regional maps
- **Risk Indicators**: Visual status indicators and badges

The design should feel like a professional intelligence briefing tool - serious, comprehensive, and built for analysis rather than marketing appeal.
